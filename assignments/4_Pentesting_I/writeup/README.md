## Assignment Writeup

### Part 1 (40 pts)

Flag - CMSC389R-{d1gging_f0r_flag5_thr0ugh_1njec7ion}

Input - ";cd home;cat flag.txt"

I connected to the server and I was asked to input an IP or domain to look up. I decided to see if I could look up the files on the server by using a semi-colon to inject commands.

I injected a command by typing in ";ls". This gave me a list of all the files on the server. Now that I knew that the semi-colon would work to inject commands, I wanted to use this to browse around the server for the flag.

I decided to check the "home" folder first by injecting the command ";cd home;ls", which is how I found the file "flag.txt". I then got the contents of the file by command injecting ";cd home;cat flag.txt", which gave me the flag above.

This vulnerability could be prevented by sanitizing inputs. This way any input is registered only as input, and not as harmful code.
