This was done via the [ELMS assignment](). (we'll post an announcement when this is ready!)

### Part 2 (75 pts)

The first point to consider is who I should inform of this issue, if anybody.  The first person to inform is my boss.  As an employee of the company, I have a fiduciary duty to inform my employer of the dangers presented by the security problems.  I should do everything in my power to make sure that my boss knows the extent of the dangers due to the security problems.  If my boss is unwilling to do anything, I should then attempt to inform other supervisors or someone in a position above my boss, if such a person exists.  The fact that the security issues could endanger lives means that I have a moral responsibility to go over my boss’ head if he refuses to listen.

Only after exhausting my options within the company should I consider informing people outside the company.  Informing people outside the company should only become an option if the company is unwilling to do anything to fix the security issues.  The outside parties to inform should be both relevant consumer watchdogs and the public.

The second point is to consider how far should I go, if at all.  I should be prepared to blow the whistle and inform relevant law enforcement agencies.  This is only if the company is unwilling to fix the ECU’s security issues or postpone the release to ensure that the firmware no longer has the security issues. 

Furthermore, the moment I discover the security issues, I should make sure that I keep a detailed record and account of everything.  The record should include, the security issues, how the security issues work, the dangers presented by the security issues, how I found the issues, who I informed within the company, steps I took to address and have the issues fixed within the company, how the company acted in response to my concerns, steps I took to inform the public if the company was unwilling to address the issues, and all relevant correspondence and communications between me and other parties regarding the issue.  This record will ensure that I am not discredited by the company so that the company can just sweep the issue under a rug.  It will also serve to protect my reputation and limit any harm to career should the company decide to retaliate.

The third point to consider is: if I do nothing, then am I responsible for any harm that result?  Yes, I would be responsible.  If I was aware of security issues that potentially endangers people and I decide to do nothing, then any harm that results from those security issues is at least partly, if not wholly, my responsibility.  The company has a duty to not intentionally endanger its customers or the public.  As a member of the company, and as a member of society, I have a moral responsibility to take action if I discover something that poses a danger to other people.
